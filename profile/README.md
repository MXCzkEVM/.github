- `MXC zkEVM` is a new zk-rollup that provides type-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
- It consists on a decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution utilising cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.
- This approach required the recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts. For this purpose a new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization.

## Ethereum compatibility
- The following table aims to summarize the zkEVM compatibility with the [official Ethereum test vectors](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
- The test vectors targeted are located [here](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests)
- Detailed information could be found in the [Documents](https://mxczkevm.github.io/SupernodeV2-devdocs/docs/intro)
